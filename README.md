# Weakly Supervised Tumour Detection

In this project we try to solve the issue of non visibility of tumours in CT. 

## Installation

Python 3.7
PyTorch

## Usage

To use the code run PipelineExecuter.py file
Inside the file you will be able to get different options on the training as well as which Dataset you would like to train the model on.
The current implementation is trained on both CHAOS dataset and Clinical dataset from University Klinikum Magdeburg
